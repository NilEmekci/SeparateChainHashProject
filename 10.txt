I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear they are blue
And I wore them just the other day
Love you know I will fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I am gonna love you either way
Love oh love I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh I cant go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I am in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Cant go a minute without your love
Love I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldnt have it any other way
Love my aim is straight and true
Cupids arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love oh love I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh I can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I am in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Cant go a minute without your love
Oh love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh, I cant go a minute without your love
Where you go I will follow
You set the pace we will take it fast and slow
I will follow in your way
You got me you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It is physics there is no escape
Love my aim is straight and true
Cupids arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love oh, love I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh I cant go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I am in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Cant go a minute without your
Love oh love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
Cause I oh I cant go a minute without your love
Love love love love love
