Years ago
When I was younger
I kinda liked
A girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then its true
Im in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
Cause I dont care if I lose my mind
Im already cursed
Every day we started fighting
Every night we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I dont know what I was doin
But suddenly we fell apart
Nowadays
I cannot find her
But when I do
Well get a brand new start
Im in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
