Bir Bir Bir Bir
You could be the one in my dreams
You could be much more than you seem
Anything I wanted in life
Do you understand what I mean
I can see that this could be fate
I can love you more than they hate
Doesnt matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game
I can see it in your eyes
